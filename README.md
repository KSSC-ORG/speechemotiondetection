Emotion recognition is a rapidly growing research domain in recent years. Unlike humans, machines lack the abilities to perceive and show emotions. 
But human-computer interaction can be improved by automated emotions recognition, thereby reducing the need of human intervention. In this project, we are going to implement four basic emotional speech signals (Anger, Happy, Fear and Neutral).
